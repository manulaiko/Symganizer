Throw all your shit to a folder and organize it with symlinks 'cuz yolo

You have an anime library and you want it to be ordered according to numerous criteria, but you don't want to use 3rd party tools to be able to browse it. Well, this is why this tool exists.

With this tool you can throw are your shitty animes in a folder and create numerous folders to keep them organized.

Imagine this is your library with your favourite trash animes:
```
|- Animes/
| |- Gabriel DropOut/
| |- Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon/
| |- Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/
| | |- 01/
| | |- 02/
| |- REEEEEEE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/
```

Cool, right? There's a directory for the show and each season is in its own directory under the show main directory. But, what if you want it to be ordered by genre, score, season or if it's hentai or not?

This tool will help you achieve that, the result will be something like this:

```
|- By Season/
| |- 2016 01 (Winter)/
| | |- Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/ -> ../../Animes/Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/01/
| |- 2016 02 (Spring)/
| | |- REEEEEEE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/ -> ../../Animes/REEEEEEE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/
| |- 2017 01 (Winter)/
| | |- Gabriel DropOut/ -> ../../Animes/Gabriel DropOut/
| | |- Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon/ -> ../../Animes/Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon/
| | |- Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo Season 2/ -> ../../Animes/Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/02/
|
|- By Genre/
| |- Slice of Life/
| | |- Gabriel DropOut/ -> ../../Animes/Gabriel DropOut/
| |- Comedy/
| | |- Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/ -> ../../Animes/Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo/
| |- Fantasy/
| | |- REEEEEEE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/ -> ../../Animes/REEEEEEE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/
```

You can use it for anything else other than anime weeb shit, you can even use it for your porn folder.

The usage is pretty easy, and once you've started the tool, it will guide you to what you need to do.
